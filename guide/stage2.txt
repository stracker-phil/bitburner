GROWTH PHASE  (less than 1TB home RAM):
============

This script will do:

  1. Spawn "grow.sh" to increase income via hacknet nodes
  2. Distribute "sgrw.sh" to all hacked servers
  3. Spawn "attk.sh" to focus attacks on a target server
  4. Run "sgrw.sh" on all hacked servers

Next steps:

* Get reputation and money by solving contracts
* Purchase Augmentations from CyberSec
* Purchase additional servers to use attk.js

Notes:

* Kill "grow.js" if "contract.js" needs more RAM
* Run "master" again after purchasing a program on the darknet
* Use "master --lock-money 0" to increase your income and purchase
  new servers as soon as possible.
