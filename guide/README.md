# guide

This folder contains some hints that are displayed by `master`.

Note that files in this folder end in `.js` but contain plain-text content instead of JavaScript. The reason is that the VS Code extension does not sync text files, only scripts. This workaround ensures that the latest version of the guide files is present within the game.
