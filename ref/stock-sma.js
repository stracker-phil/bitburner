COMMENT CONTEXT:
"I did some tweaks to to the stock trading scripts to try and smooth out fluctuations in pricing causing frequent swaps in position and contributing to a slow bleed in money. I also added a small script to read new investment values from since killing/restarting the scripts to set a new investment value kinda sucks.
Combined, all of them running use up 31.90 GB, so any further improvements either need to cut something else or accept the fact that it can't work on a starting computer. The stock-sma script would be the best starting point, since I just bolted changes onto it without seeing if I could slim it down with its new purpose in mind.
Revised stock-sma.script"
